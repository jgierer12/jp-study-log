## Goal Review

Since the last post on April 22, I...

### ✅ Reached WK level 5

I'm pretty far into level 5 and should get to level 6 by the end of the week, so I'm progressing pretty much exactly as planned. New material in WaniKani is starting to get a little bit harder to memorize, but it's still very manageable. When I unlocked level 5, I suddenly got around 100 new lessons all at once which felt kind of overwhelming, but I've been consistently doing 20-25 of them every day so that number quickly started to look less scary.

What's great is that I'm starting to learn some actually useful words now. Due to WaniKani's approach of teaching visually simple kanji first (rather than kanji with simple meanings), a lot of the early kanji and vocab are actually pretty niche. For example, some words you learn early on are 矢 (arrow), 貝 (shellfish) and かき氷 (shaved ice). Not exactly things that you would encounter super often in everyday Japanese. They are based on some simple radicals though, that's why they appear so early. But in level 5 I noticed that I learned a ton of useful kanji and words: 多 (many), 来 (come), 近 (near), 行 (go) and of course 何 (nani?!) just to name a few. Learning these kinds of common words is really motivating and I also tend to find their readings easier to memorize since I heard most of them before somewhere.

### ✅ Set up a regular schedule for studying

The 19:00 - 23:00 - 7:00 schedule has been working great for me. Especially the 19:00 - 23:00 interval is really important: Making sure that I revise all learned items after 4 hours has noticeably improved my review accuracy. Also, this schedule leaves the entire rest of the afternoon free for doing other stuff. Before, I checked into WaniKani every 1-2 hours and would do my reviews in really small batches throughout the entire afternoon, but with just 3 larger batches of revews per day it feels like I'm spending less time to do the same amount of study (or more).

Another tool that really helped me is the [Self-Study Quiz](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-self-study-quiz/13191). I use this after doing my lessons to revise them until I get a 100% score twice. This has significantly decreased the amount of items I get wrong 4 hours later in the first actual review. I'm also trying out a few other userscripts for WaniKani which I will write about in a future log because I'm not sure yet which ones I'm going to keep using. The Self-Study Quiz is by far the most impactful one though.

### (sort of) ✅ Started reading Genki

I did start Genki, but quickly noticed that I was going through it way too fast while barely remembering any of the vocab and grammar. So I need to find a way to take it slow and make sure I actually learn everything the book teaches. One benefit of WaniKani is that new lessons are locked until you prove that you learned the previous lessons, obviously this isn't a thing with a physical textbook like Genki. To sort of simulate that, I'll be doing a few things:

1. Use Anki (there is a pre-made [Genki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1742947823)) to learn all of a chapter's vocabulary *before* starting the chapter. For example, right now I'm learning chapter 1 vocab. Only once I start seeing chapter 2 vocab in Anki, I'll start reading chapter 1 in the book.

2. After reading a chapter, watch [ToKini Andy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaQBL4XHuSo&list=PLA_RcUI8km1NMhiEebcbqdlcHv_2ngbO2)'s video on it. This helps clear up anything that was left unclear in the book and hear additional examples for the grammar.

3. Use [Genki Exercises](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/) to practice the grammar until I'm confident that I've remembered all of it.

4. Finally, go through the reading and writing part of the chapter at the end of the book to get even more practice.

Obviously I'm still very early on in the book so I might change some stuff about this process as I go on. But for now that's the way I plan on working with Genki. Like I mentioned last time, grammar has a pretty low priority for me right now so I want to make sure not to spend too much time per day on this.

Also, I won't bother learning any kanji from Genki, since they will come up in WaniKani sooner or later anyways which is a much better platform to learn them. I'll focus on just the meanings and readings of Genki vocab.

## New Goals

## Next 1-2 weeks

*To be reviewed in the next study log*

- Try reading more
    - [In the beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWKB8zdVM-U), I constantly tried reading random tweets and news even when I could only read the hiragana and not understand a single word. That naturally got old pretty fast and my study resources started taking up more time so I stopped doing it. But I'm now at a point where I can read a few words here and there so I want to get into a habit of looking at a small piece of native text every day and seeing if I can understand any part of it.

- Complete Genki chapter 1 for real this time
    - I think I'm about halfway through the vocab so that should allow me to re-start Genki pretty soon. The grammar itself is really simple in this one so I should get through it quickly once I "unlock" it.
