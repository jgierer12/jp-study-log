A few weeks ago, I started studying Japanese! I'm enjoying it way more than expected and hope to stick with it for a long time, so I decided to set up a study log. This will help me plan and review long-term goals and track my progress learning the language. I expect to write one or two of these per month.

## Recap

For this first log, I'll recap how I started learning Japanese and how I spent my first weeks.

### Week 1

I've always been into Japanese media (mostly manga, anime and VTubers), and of course I sometimes wished I could understand it without relying on English translations. I never actually considered learning Japanese though - I used to be under the impression that Japanese was this impossibly hard language and trying to study it would take way more time than it's worth. Until exactly 4 weeks ago, on March 25 2022, when I came across Zach Daniel's post "[Learning How to Learn Japanese](https://zachdaniel.dev/learning-how-to-learn-japanese/)" (I don't actually remember where I found this, probably some random Reddit or Twitter thread). This post made the whole thing sound surprisingly simple, and it intrigued me enough to sign up to [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/).

Before I knew it, I was starting to learn my first kanji. The barrier to entry is really low with this app, you essentially just sign up and after a short intro it immediately teaches you some super easy radicals (which are like building blocks for kanji). The WaniKani introduction also noted that kana knowledge would be required going forward, so I used [Tofugu's Hiragana Guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/), which is created by the same people who make WaniKani. Following the guide which features memorable mnemonics and a [quiz app](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) specifically built for this guide, I was able to learn how to read hiragana within a day. A few days later, I also learned [katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) in the same way.

### Week 2

I was making steady progress in WaniKani, but at this point I didn't really know much about WaniKani and learning Japanese other than what Zach Daniel's post taught me. So I went ahead and read through some [WaniKani community](https://community.wanikani.com/) posts. This is a really valuable resource, a huge community with tons of great threads, book clubs and much more. I learned that most users recommend focusing on learning kanji for at least the first 6 months, since everything else (grammar, listening, reading and production) is limited by your kanji knowledge. I also started learning about some other popular resources such as the Genki textbooks for grammar and the [NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) site for reading practice.

### Week 3

WaniKani only trains you to translate Japanese kanji/vocab into English, but not the other way around. This is great for learning kanji quickly, but of course knowing the English -> Japanese direction is also important for text production. To practice this, I started using [KameSame](https://www.kamesame.com/), but I don't want this to take away from my time spent on WK. Essentially just doing this when I don't have any pending reviews or lessons in WK.

I'm doing KameSame on my phone most of the time in order to learn the Japanese 12-key keyboard layout. This was pretty challenging at first but I quickly started building up some muscle memory and now I'm almost as fast typing on my phone as I'm on a PC using romaji input. I'll definitely continue doing this to get more comfortable with typing on this layout.

### Week 4

Because I was out of town this week, I installed the [Flaming Durtles](https://community.wanikani.com/t/android-flaming-durtles-android-app-with-offline-support/38400) app, an excellent community-made Android client for WaniKani that fixes some of the shortcomings of the WK mobile website, allowing me to do my lessons and reviews on the go.

I also found [this wonderful post](https://community.wanikani.com/t/my-journey-of-368-days-the-ultimate-guide-for-wk/31318) which goes over a LOT of tips for learning Japanese.

The biggest thing I took away from this is that I need to get into a specific schedule for my reviews and lessons. Until now, I've kind of just done lessons once a day at a random time, and reviews whenever I had time. But WaniKani's SRS (Spaced Repitition System) actually has intervals that heavily favor a schedule where you do revies at 3 specific times every day: The first review after you learn an item will show up after 4 hours, then (assuming you passed the review) 8 hours later, then 1 day, 2 days and so on. This means a schedule with 3 review sessions per day at these intervals will be the most efficient way to do WaniKani. I have university lectures in the morning on most days, so putting the 4-hour interval in the morning wouldn't really work. My best option probably is to do reviews and lessons at around 19:00, the second review session at 23:00, and the third session right after I wake up at around 7:00-8:00.

I also bought a copy of the Genki textbook which is widely regarded as the best resource for learning Japanese grammar. Some time next week I'll start going through this, but as with KameSame I don't want to overdo it and take away time from WaniKani.

## Where I'm at

Currently, I'm at the start of WaniKani level 4, meaning that I've learned 82 kanji and 168 words using those kanji (at Guru rank or higher). Considering I didn't even know how to read hiragana just a month ago, I would say that's a pretty decent amount. I got familiar with WaniKani's approach to teaching and like it a lot. Looking at NHK Easy News and Twitter, I'm starting to recognize some kanji here and there, but I still have a loooong way to go before I can fluidly read them without looking up most words. Even so, just being able to read hiragana and katakana is already a pretty amazing feeling.

In total I'm spending around 1-2 hours on studying Japanese per day, there's definitely room for more there but I'd rather take it slow so I don't get burnt out.

## Goals

### Next 1-2 weeks

*To be reviewed in the next study log*

- Reach WK level 5 or 6
    - I'm 3 days into level 4, so I should get to level 5 in less than a week at my current pace.
- Set up a regular schedule for studying
    - As said above, I'm thinking about a 19:00 - 23:00 - 7:00 schedule
- Start reading Genki

### Next 3 months

*To be reviewed around July 2022*

- Think about my motivations for learning Japanese
    - Right now I'm basically just doing it because it's fun and I have a lot of free time, but I really need to think about some actual motivations and long-term goals. Do I just want to understand manga and anime without translations? Do I want to be able to travel to Japan? Some other goals?
- Reach WK level 10
- Read some amount of Genki chapters
    - Very vague goal, I know. I'm not sure yet how long it will take to finish a chapter.
- Read at least one whole NHK Easy News article
    - I'm expecting that to be pretty hard at this stage, but I really want to get started reading "real" Japanese sooner rather than later.

### Next year

*To be reviewed around March 2023*

- Reach WK level 30
    - According to many users in the WaniKani community, level 30 is a good point to start shifting focus from WK to other resources. If I consistently study WK every day, this should be doable within a year.
- Finish Genki 1
- Start using [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp) (grammar SRS)
- Be able to read NHK Easy News without looking up more than 20% of vocab
- Join one of the book clubs on the WK forum
- Get started with studying listening comprehension
- Bonus goal: Start talking to native Japanese speakers
    - Using platforms like [HelloTalk](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/hellotalk/)
    - To be honest, anxiety will probably be a bigger problem here than language, so I'll leave this as a very optional zero-pressure bonus goal.

### Long term

- The primary goal is understanding written and spoken Japanese
- Learning how to (digitally) write and eventually speak the language is also a goal, but just a secondary one at this point
- Handwriting kanji is not really something I'm interested in right now

That's it for my first Japanese study log, hopefully many more to come!
