There honestly isn't that much to talk about this time around, but I guess that's a good thing. These last few weeks I've been focusing on consistently keeping up my study times every day which has been working great! I'm making steady progress in all the apps I'm using, and restarting Genki with the new method I talked about in the last post has been a success as well.

## Goal Review

My goals for the last two weeks were...

### ✅ Try reading more

I'm making sure to look at a few NHK Easy News headlines and/or random Japanese tweets every day. I would say I can recognize around 1/3 of the Kanji on there, which isn't bad considering I've only been doing this for about 2 months, but of course I'm still nowhere near the point where I can read anything fluidly. The more kanji I'm able to read, the more I realize that there is a lot of grammar knowledge that will be necessary as well in order to be able to understand full sentences.

### ✅ Complete Genki chapter 1 for real this time

Around one week ago, I finished the first chapter of Genki vocab in Anki. Like planned, I then started going through the chapter in the book again, then the ToKini Andy video, the exercises and the reading/writing chapter 1. This was a really simple chapter, but I can already tell that the new strategy helps me understand the grammar a lot better. Already knowing all the words without having to look any of them up during lessons and exercises is also a huge time saver and helps me focus on the grammar alone.

In a few more days I'll complete the chapter 2 vocab. This will allow me to move on to chapter 2 in the book, which I didn't completely read yet before restarting the book, so it will be a good test to see how much this new approach improves things.

## New Goals

### Next 1-2 weeks

*To be reviewed in the next study log*

- Reach WaniKani level 8

- Complete Genki chapter 2

- Look for something to read
    - I'm eager to start reading some actual Japanese material. I plan on taking a look at some of the entry level graded readers on [Tadoku Supporters](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/) and see if I can read any of them.
