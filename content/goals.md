This page will be updated with my current Japanese study goals. See [Archive](/) for past goals and their reviews.

### Next 1-2 weeks

*As of 2022-05-02 - To be reviewed in the next study log*

- Try reading more
    - In the beginning, I constantly tried reading random tweets and news even when I could only read the hiragana and not understand a single word. That naturally got old pretty fast and my study resources started taking up more time so I stopped doing it. But I'm now at a point where I can read a few words here and there so I want to get into a habit of looking at a small piece of native text every day and seeing if I can understand any part of it.

- Complete Genki chapter 1 for real this time
    - I think I'm about halfway through the vocab so that should allow me to re-start Genki pretty soon. The grammar itself is really simple in this one so I should get through it quickly once I "unlock" it.

### Next 3 months

*As of 2022-04-22 - To be reviewed around July 2022*

- Think about my motivations for learning Japanese
    - Right now I'm basically just doing it because it's fun and I have a lot of free time, but I really need to think about some actual motivations and long-term goals. Do I just want to understand manga and anime without translations? Do I want to be able to travel to Japan? Some other goals?
- Reach WK level 10
- Read some amount of Genki chapters
    - This is very vague but I don't really know yet how long it will take to finish a chapter.
- Read at least one whole NHK article
    - I know this will probably be pretty hard, but I want to get started reading Japanese text.

### Next year

*As of 2022-04-22 - To be reviewed around March 2023*

- Reach WK level 30
    - According to many users in the WaniKani community, level 30 is a good point to start shifting focus from WK to other resources. If I consistently study WK every day, this should be doable within a year.
- Finish Genki 1
- Start using [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp) (grammar SRS)
- Be able to read NHK Easy News without looking up more than 20% of vocab
- Join one of the book clubs on the WK forum
- Get started with listening comprehension
- Bonus goal: Start talking to native Japanese speakers
    - Using platforms like [HelloTalk](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/hellotalk/)
    - I'll be real, anxiety will probably be a bigger problem here than language, so I'll leave this as a very optional zero-pressure bonus goal.

### Long term

- The primary goal is understanding written and spoken Japanese
- Learning how to (digitally) write and eventually speak the language is also a goal, but just a secondary one at this point
- Handwriting kanji is not really something I'm interested in right now
